## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a system built into GitHub that allows you to build websites directly from a GitHub Repository.

There are two kinds of GitHub Pages:

- Personal websites (associated with an account)
- Repository Specific Websites (webpages for software or projects)

We will cover the personal website for today.

## Why GitHub Pages?

GitHub is a highly dependable webhost, and you get one personal webpage account for free.  Plus, if you move institutions, your website can travel with you.

Because GitHub pages is compatible with Markdown, we'll be using Markdown formatting to build our webpage.

## Goal for the workshop

We're going to build a personal webpage which will live at USERNAME.github.io.  

There is a live example of the template here: https://laderast.github.io/academic_site_workshop/.

## What you need for the workshop

You don't need to know how to code or know HTML to setup a GitHub Page.  It would be helpful, but not necessary, to have the following on hand to add some first website content:

- A short bio
- A headshot (or another image that represents your professional interests)

## Getting started

The workshop starts with first steps [on the next page here](../first-steps).

During the workshop, be sure to use your sticky notes as a flag if you're stuck and one of the facilitators will help you.
